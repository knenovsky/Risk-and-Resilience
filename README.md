# Abstract

**Background:** During the global COVID-19 pandemic (2020â€“2021), excess mortality varied substantially across countries. Notably, upper-middle-income countries experienced greater variability in excess mortality than both low- and high-income countries, despite reporting fewer COVID-19 cases. This disconnect between case numbers and mortality suggests more complex structural vulnerabilities. Socioeconomic conditions and healthcare system performance, collectively referred to as National Framework Conditions (*NFCs*), are likely key determinants of pandemic outcomes. However, the specific relationship between these factors and excess mortality remains poorly understood.

**Methods::** We constructed a predictive model of excess mortality using reported COVID-19 case counts and a wide array of *NFCs* derived from the World Development Indicators (WDI), employing a tree-based machine learning method (XGBoost). To reduce dimensionality, we applied a non-linear method (e-Isomap), extracting latent components called compressed National Framework Conditions (*cNFCs*). We applied SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to estimate the feature importance and quantify the contribution of each *cNFC*.

**Results:** Our machine learning model explained nearly half of the global variance in excess mortality (*R^2*: median 49.7; IQR: 10.9). SHAP analysis revealed that *cNFCs* contributed most strongly to model predictions of excess mortality (Median: 8.1, IQR: 1.2), followed by *pandemic indicators*, such as reported COVID-19 cases (Median: 6.4, IQR: 0.7). Using explainable AI, we further identified how interconnected socioeconomic conditions, including labor force participation age and health spending, shaped mortality outcomes.


**Conclusion** Our findings demonstrate that *cNFCs* outperform conventional epidemiological or preparedness metrics. By capturing latent socioeconomic structures, the *cNFC* framework reveals systemic vulnerabilities that reported COVID-19 cases and other indicators fail to detect. This approach offers a new perspective on
